        2) I have saved the 4th most appeared characters in a dictionary.
        3) I went over the string and I had replaced the text with dictionary key-value and got the decrypted text#the text results. 
        4)save and add the decrypted text to the original text file and creat a file containing the decrypted
        5)find the longest words in the file results.txt
        6)    count the number of lines in the results.txt
